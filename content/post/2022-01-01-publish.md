> Thinking about sharing some interesting content on the web? Modern tools make it easy to publish content for free. 

## Choosing An Approach

Writers who don't want to work directly in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (three key technologies for building web sites) often chose a such as WordPress. 

There's another option - using a "static site generator". For these, content is written in a simple markup language and then run through a process to create the HTML for a web page. Hugo is a static site generator written in Go. 

These notes show you how to use Hugo and GitHub to get your blog up and running in about an hour.

## Create Two GitHub Repositories

Create a free account on [GitHub](https://github.com/pricing). You'll choose a username and provide an email address and password. Your username will become part of your hosted URL (the address of your website). You can use your GitHub account to create respositories (typically called **repos** for short). Each repo is like a folder or directory that holds a variety of files for a particular project. 

We'll create two repos: one private (for writing) and one public (for publishing). 

1. Create one new GitHub repo for writing. Make it private with no files. It will hold the source. I call mine `notes-source`, but blog-source or something similar will work great. 
2. Create one new GitHub repo for the deployed content. Make it public with no files. It will hold the content that will be published with GitHub Pages. I call mine `notes`, but blog or similar would work as well. 

In your second (public) repo, click Settings. For example, this takes me to <https://github.com/denisecase/notes/settings>, but you'll need to change `denisecase` to your GitHub username and `notes` to your public repo name (e.g. blog).

In the repo settings, scroll down to "GitHub Pages" / click "Check it out here!".
Change "None" to `main` / click "Save".

It will display the URL for your free site. Mine is https://denisecase.github.io/notes/, but you'll need to change `denisecase` to your username and `notes` to the name of your public repo. 

-----

## Install Basic Tools

You'll need Git and Go installed.  

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version control system. Configure Git with your username and email. 
- [Go](https://go.dev/) programming language.
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for editing files (recommended, not required).

Note: 
Package managers can make it easy to install software and keep it current. 
On Windows, I use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install). 
Follow the instructions to install Chocolatey, then open PowerShell as Administrator and run the following commands. 

```PowerShell
choco install git -y
choco install golang -y
refreshenv
git --version
go version
```

## Install Hugo

[Install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing) static site generator. 

For example, on Windows using Chocolatey, run the following. 

```PowerShell
choco install hugo-extended -y -confirm
refreshenv
hugo version
```

## Create a Source Repo on Your Local Machine

Use Hugo to generate a new site named the same as your new private repo. 
My commands are as follows - adjust them to use your GitHub username instead of `denisecase`, 
and your repo name instead of `notes-source`.

```PowerShell
hugo new site notes-source
cd notes-source
hugo mod init github.com/denisecase/notes-source
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/halogenica/beautifulhugo.git themes/beautifulhugo
```

## Customize Hugo Configuration

Customize config.toml. See example in this repo and <https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/beautifulhugo/>. I recommend copying the information from the <config.toml> file in this repo into yours, then editing yours to reflect your URL, author information, and content. 

-----

## Run Your Site Locally

```PowerShell
hugo server
```

Open browser to <http://localhost:1313/notes>. Replace `notes` with the name of your PUBLIC repo you created at the beginning. 

ERROR? If you get this error: "Failed to read Git log: fatal: your current branch 'main' does not have any commits yet" you have `enableGitInfo = true` in config.toml, but there's nothing to report. Set config.toml enableGitInfo to `false` until everything is working. 

## Once It Runs, Add More Content

Create additional files in your repo by using the examples in this repo

- .gitignore
- README.md 
- .github/workflows/deploy.yml 
- content/post/_index.md 
- content/post/2022-01-01-publish.md 

Edits:

- The first file, .gitignore shouldn't need changes. 
- Customize the README.md as you like - it's like an "About" page for your project, and won't appear in your hosted website. 
- deploy.yml is discussed later is used to auto copy and deploy. Find the line with external_repository: denisecase/notes and change it to use your GitHub account name (instead of `denisecase`) and your PUBLIC repo name (instead of `notes`).
- _index.md is the opening page of your blog - customize it as you like. 
- You'll need to change the name and contents of the last file - it's your first article. Be sure to follow the naming conventions and be careful when editing the contents. Errors can keep your site from running. If you get them just go back to the content in this repo and then slowly modify it while running. If it breaks, you'll know where to focus. 

## One Time: Create A GitHub Personal Access Token 

In .github/workflows/deploy.yml, we see `personal_token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_TOKEN }}`. 
This tells GitHub we have authorization to write to a different repository which will then use GitHub Pages to host.  

Create a GitHub Personal Access Token by following the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token). Set the token to never expire (or choose a different date) and check the top-level box for `repo` and `admin:repo_hook`.

## One Time: Link Local Source Repo to GitHub Source Repo

We've already run git init to create a git repo locally. Now we want to change the default branch to main, set the origin alias to your GitHub repo URL, then git add all the files, git commit our changes, and then git push up the cloud repo. Change `denisecase` to your GitHub username and `notes-source` to your new private repo. 

```PowerShell
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/denisecase/notes-source.git
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git push -u origin main
```

-----

## Recurring: Watch Your Site As You Code

If your site is still running, you'll see the changes in the browser as you make edits. If your site is not running (or if you get errors), edit the content then restart the site with `hugo server` and open browser to <http://localhost:1313/notes>. Replace `notes` with the name of your PUBLIC repo you created at the beginning. 

## Recurring: After Adding New Content

After adding content, always do a git add all files, git commit with a message, and git push up to GitHub.

```PowerShell
git add .
git commit -m "added new content"
git push -u origin main
```
